		<h1>2. CBT Therapy is the Most Widely-Used Therapy for Anxiety Disorder</h1>
		<p>Therapy is effective for individuals because it helps individuals determine causes for their emotions and provides them with corrective experiences. For example, if an individual has a very active sympathetic nervous system, the therapist may teach exercises that activate the parasympathetic nervous system such as mindfullness meditation. CBT Therapy or cognitive based therapy has proven to be highly effective for people battling anxiety disorder. It focuses on managing ones thoughts and behavior. Through CBT, individuals learn how to challenge their anxious thoughts and replace them with ones that are more realistic. This challenging is known as cognitive restructuring. CBT also helps individuals identify triggers for their anxiety<a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/anxiety/therapy-for-anxiety-disorders.htm" style="color:#BA89B6">(helpguide)</a></p>

		<h1>3. Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Shows Promise in Alleviating Depressive Symptoms</h1>
		<p>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is a form of brain stimulation used to treat depression after patients have exacerbated all their options. It involves applying magnetic fields to parts of the brain that play a role in depression. Over 50% of patients who were not helped by antidepressants have conveyed that they have experienced relief from TMS- one third of which went into remission. It is known to be safe, noninvase, and actually seems to present less grueling symptoms than antidepressants.

		<h1>4. Exercise Helps With Mood</h1>
		<p>You have probably heard this many times before, but here's another reminder. Exercise releases endorphins and also serves as a distraction from negative thoughts. Thus, exercise ends up lowering stress and is also great for your physical health. If you cannot go to the gym or perform vigorous exercise, even simple things such as daily walks and yoga are a great start. I always look forward to my evening walks.
		<h1>5. Relationship Between Brain Activity and Anxiety and Depressive Disorder</h1>
		<p>People who experience depressive disorder usually have reduced brain activity in certain areas, such as the prefrontal cortex. Usually people with depressive disorder experience heightened activity in the limbic sytstem,the system responsible for handling emotions. Patients with anxiety disorder tend to have heightened activity in the amygdala and certain studies have shown larger amygdalas amongst children with anxiety disorders<a href="https://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_08/d_08_cr/d_08_cr_anx/d_08_cr_anx.html" style="color:#BA89B6">(thebrain)</a></p>
